# HHA504_assignment_vms
Assignment for HHA 504

## *Objective*

The objective of this assignment is to provide hands-on experience with managing Virtual Machines (VMs) in both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will learn how to start, stop, and monitor the costs associated with running VMs on these cloud platforms.

# *1. Start and Stop a Virtual Machine*

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

The steps I took to start and stop the Virtual Machine within Google Cloud Platform include: 

    1.  Opening GCP dashboard.
    
    2. Clicking on "VM instances" under the tab called "Virtual Machines."

    3. Created a new instance with the Virtual Machine name, "virtual-machine-1."

    4. Adjusted the region to "us-east4 (Northern Virginia)."

    5. Confirmed "Machine Configuration/Machine Type" was under "E2-medium."

    6. Ensured settings were "standard/basic."

    7. Created virtual machine.

    8. Allowed new virtual machine to run for a few minutes. 

    9. Stopped virtual machine by clicking the hamburger button bar adjacent to the Virtual Machine instance named, "virtual-machine-1."

# *2. Monitor VM Costs*

## Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

    I was able to monitor the costs for GCP by accessing the "Billing" section of GCP. I navigated towards:
        
        1- "Billing Overview" 
        2- "Billing Reports"
        3- "Billing Cost Table"
        4- "Billing Cost Breakdown"
    
    There were no costs recorded at this time. There were no costs due to the VM not being able to run for a sufficient amount of time to aquire such costs. However, if the VM ran for an extended period of time, the charges would be able to be easily viewed under "Cost Breakdown."
